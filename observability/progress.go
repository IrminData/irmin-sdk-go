// Package observability defines the shared progress-event vocabulary
// used across Irmin services and connectors. The types here are pure
// data — no database, no logger, no transport. Sink-aware helpers
// (e.g., emission to an OperationLog table or a stream response) live
// in the consuming service since the right sink differs per service:
//
//   - irmin-connectors emits to OperationLog rows via
//     LogOperationProgress + LogOperationEvent.
//   - irmin Core emits to WorkflowRun.Logs via WorkflowLogBuilder.
//   - irmin-ai emits as NDJSON stream events to the chat client.
//
// Centralising the vocabulary (kinds, event shape, handler signature)
// here keeps the operator-facing semantics consistent across those
// surfaces — a "page" event means the same thing in every service —
// and lets external connector authors building against this SDK reach
// the types directly without depending on irmin-connectors internals.
//
// The vocabulary was lifted from irmin-connectors/connectors/common,
// where it shipped first as the fix for a 10-minute Stripe import
// that emitted zero log rows. Background:
// see irmin-connectors/guides/how-to-create-connectors.md.

// ProgressEvent is a single observability event emitted from a
// long-running operation. Producers fire these into a ProgressHandler;
// the handler is responsible for turning them into the right output
// shape for its sink (DB row, log line, stream event, etc.).
//
// Not every field is meaningful for every Kind — see the field docs.
// The Kind discriminator selects which subset applies.
//
// JSON tags are provided so ProgressEvent can round-trip across the
// async operation /operation/status wire format. Field names are
// snake_case and every per-kind field is marked omitempty so a
// "page" event doesn't carry zero-valued file/rate-limit fields on
// the wire. Tag values are part of that wire format and must stay
// stable across services.

	// processed: an API path ("/v1/customers"), a table name
	// ("public.orders"), a file path ("inbox/report.csv"), an
	// index URI ("pinecone://my-index"). Should always be set so
	// operators with multiple targets per workflow can disambiguate.

	// --- Pagination (ProgressKindPage) ---

	// Page is the 1-based page number within the current pagination
	// loop.

	// Attempt is the 1-based retry attempt (1 = first retry, 2 = second, …).

	// events without colliding with a meaningful "first retry" value —
	// matching the Page and Batch conventions.

	// lossless; consumers that prefer seconds can convert.

	// --- Chunked upload (ProgressKindBatch) ---

	// Batch is the 1-based batch index.
	Batch int `json:"batch,omitempty"`
	// BatchSize is the number of records in this batch.
	BatchSize int `json:"batch_size,omitempty"`

	// --- SQL query progress (ProgressKindQuery) ---

	// Rows is the cumulative number of rows processed.
	Rows int64 `json:"rows,omitempty"`

// stable across services and across language boundaries (a
